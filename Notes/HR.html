    <h1>HR Interview Q&amp;A — Shubham Daundkar</h1>

    <h2>1. Tell me about yourself</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Shubham Daundkar. I have 4+ years of experience as a
      software developer. Currently I am working as a Senior Developer at Wipro
      on the Aviva Insurance UK project. I am strong in C#, ASP.NET Core,
      Angular, and SQL Server. I write clean code, conduct code reviews, and
      mentor junior developers. I am looking to grow further with more
      challenging projects.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What are your top strengths?</h2>
    <p>
      My first strength is problem solving. For example, I solved a complex
      microservices debugging issue that was taking 2–3 days and reduced it to 2
      hours using correlation ID logging.
    </p>
    <p>
      My second strength is learning quickly. When I needed to integrate SOAP
      services despite only having REST experience, I studied the documentation
      and delivered the integration on time.
    </p>
    <p>
      My third strength is code quality. I achieved 80% unit test coverage on
      the Aviva project and regularly conduct code reviews to maintain standards
      across the team.
    </p>

    <h2>3. What is your biggest weakness?</h2>
    <p>
      I sometimes spend too much time perfecting my code, which can slow down
      delivery. I became aware of this during project work and now I use time
      limits and check in with my manager to balance quality with deadlines. I
      have improved a lot at this and it has made me more effective as a
      developer overall.
    </p>

    <h2>4. What is your biggest achievement?</h2>
    <p>
      My biggest achievement is solving a critical debugging problem in our 30+
      microservices system at Aviva. Whenever an issue occurred it was very hard
      to trace which service caused it, and debugging was taking 2–3 days each
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I implemented a correlation ID logging solution that attaches a unique ID
      to every request and passes it across all services. This reduced debugging
      time from 2–3 days to about 2 hours — an 85% improvement. More than 10
      developers on the team now use this solution and it has become a best
      practice in the project.
    </p>

    <h2>5. What is your current role and responsibility?</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently working as a Senior Software Developer at Wipro on the
      Aviva Insurance UK project. Aviva is one of the largest insurance
      providers in the UK, serving millions of customers across 50+ products
      like life, motor, home, and pensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      My team has 10+ developers and we work in 2-week Agile sprints. My main
      responsibilities include developing ASP.NET Core APIs, building MVC
      applications, fixing bugs, and delivering new features. I also conduct
      code reviews, mentor junior developers, and provide production support. I
      maintain 80% code coverage with unit tests across the project.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Can you explain your current project architecture?</h2>
    <p>
      Aviva is an enterprise-scale insurance platform serving millions of
      customers across the UK with 50+ products including life, motor, home, and
      pensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The architecture is microservices-based with 30+ independent backend
      services such as policy, claims, documents, and quotes. The frontend is
      Angular with a central "My Portfolio" dashboard where customers access all
      their products. Sub-applications like "My Protection" and "My Motor" sit
      underneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The backend is ASP.NET Core Web APIs, the database is SQL Server, and the
      infrastructure runs on AWS. Security is handled through JWT and OAuth 2.0.
      My role is primarily in the backend — developing and maintaining the
      ASP.NET Core APIs and integrating them with the microservices layer.
    </p>

    <h2>7. What challenges did you face and how did you handle them?</h2>
    <p>
      One challenge was debugging in a 30+ microservices system. Issues were
      very hard to trace and were taking days to resolve. I implemented
      correlation ID logging which reduced debugging time by 85%.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another challenge was working with unclear requirements. I started
      proactively discussing requirements with the business analyst before
      writing any code, which reduced rework significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third challenge was learning SOAP services, which I had no prior
      experience with. I studied the documentation thoroughly and successfully
      delivered the integration on time.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Can you explain one of your personal projects?</h2>
    <p>
      I built a web-based Healthcare Management System for clinics to replace
      manual paper-based processes. It handles patient management, appointment
      scheduling, and prescription tracking.
    </p>
    <p>
      It supports three types of users — doctors, nurses, and receptionists —
      each with their own role-based access. Key features include patient
      registration with validation, appointment scheduling with automatic
      conflict detection, digital prescriptions, and full medical history
      tracking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tech stack was Angular with TypeScript for the frontend, ASP.NET Core
      Web API for the backend, and SQL Server for the database. I built the
      entire project end to end, which gave me strong full-stack experience
      before joining Wipro.
    </p>

    <h2>9. What were you doing before joining Wipro?</h2>
    <p>
      After completing my engineering degree I spent some time preparing for
      competitive exams, which built strong discipline and focus in me.
    </p>
    <p>
      During that time I also did freelance development with a friend. We built
      several real-world projects including a travel agency application, a
      business website, and a clinic management application. I used .NET
      Framework, ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, jQuery, and SQL Server for those
      projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      That freelance experience gave me solid full-stack skills — from database
      design to backend logic to frontend UI — which helped me hit the ground
      running when I joined Wipro.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Why are you looking for a job change?</h2>
    <p>
      I have had a really good experience at Wipro and I have learned a lot
      working on a large-scale enterprise system. I have no complaints at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, I feel I am ready to take on more challenging projects and grow
      further as a developer. I am looking for a team that values code quality
      and best practices, a culture of continuous learning, and opportunities to
      take on more responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your company stood out to me because of the kind of work you do and the
      growth opportunities you offer, and I am genuinely excited about this
      role.
